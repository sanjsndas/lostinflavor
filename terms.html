                <p>
                    At LOSTINFLAVOR, we believe in resolving disputes amicably. In the event of any controversy or claim arising out of or relating to these Terms, or the breach thereof, the parties shall first attempt to settle the dispute through negotiation and good faith discussions.

                        <strong>Informal Resolution:</strong>
                        <p>
                            Before initiating any formal legal action, both you and LOSTINFLAVOR agree to first attempt to resolve any disputes informally. This involves communicating directly with our support team to discuss the issue and seek a mutually agreeable solution. This step is intended to save time and resources for both parties.
                        </p>

                        <strong>Binding Arbitration:</strong>
                        <p>
                            Except for certain types of disputes described below, you agree that disputes between you and LOSTINFLAVOR will be resolved by binding, individual arbitration. Arbitration is a less formal process than a lawsuit in court and uses a neutral arbitrator instead of a judge or jury. This means you are waiving your right to a trial by jury or to participate in a class action.
                        </p>
                    </li>

                        <strong>Exceptions to Arbitration:</strong>
                        <p>
                            Notwithstanding the above, nothing in these Terms will be deemed to waive, preclude, or otherwise limit the right of either party to: (a) bring an individual action in small claims court; (b) pursue an enforcement action through the applicable federal, state, or local agency if that action is available; (c) seek injunctive relief in a court of law; or (d) file suit in a court of law to address an intellectual property infringement claim.

                <p>
                    We may terminate or suspend your account and bar access to the Site immediately, without prior notice or liability, under our sole discretion, for any reason whatsoever and without limitation, including but not limited to a breach of the Terms.

                        <strong>Termination by LOSTINFLAVOR:</strong>
                        <p>
                            LOSTINFLAVOR reserves the right to terminate or suspend your access to all or part of the Site, including your account, at any time, with or without cause, with or without notice, effective immediately. Reasons for termination may include, but are not limited to, breach of these Terms, fraudulent activity, or any conduct that we deem harmful to other users or the integrity of the Site.

                        <strong>Termination by User:</strong>
                        <p>
                            You may terminate your account at any time by contacting our support team or by using any available account deletion features on the Site. Upon termination, your right to use the Site will immediately cease. Any provisions of these Terms which by their nature should survive termination shall survive termination, including, without limitation, ownership provisions, warranty disclaimers, indemnity, and limitations of liability.
                        </p>

                <h2>14. Severability</h2>
                <p>
                    If any provision of these Terms is held to be invalid or unenforceable by a court, the remaining provisions of these Terms will remain in effect.
                </p>

                    <li>
                        <strong>Partial Invalidity:</strong>
                        <p>
                            Should any provision of these Terms be found to be invalid, illegal, or unenforceable by a court of competent jurisdiction, that specific provision will be severed from the remainder of the Terms. This severance will not affect the validity or enforceability of the remaining provisions, which will continue in full force and effect.
                        </p>
                    </li>

                        <strong>Intent of Parties:</strong>
                        <p>
                            In such a scenario, the invalid or unenforceable provision will be replaced with a valid and enforceable provision that most closely reflects the original intent of the parties. This ensures that the overall purpose and spirit of these Terms are maintained even if a particular clause is deemed unenforceable.
                        </p>
