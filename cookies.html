                <p><strong>Effective Date: July 3, 2025</strong></p>
                <p>
                    This Cookie Policy explains what cookies are, how LOSTINFLAVOR.com ("the Site," "we," "us," or "our") uses cookies and similar technologies, and your choices regarding cookies. By continuing to use our Site, you are agreeing to our use of cookies in accordance with this policy. If you do not agree to the use of cookies, please adjust your browser settings or refrain from using the Site.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We may update this Cookie Policy from time to time to reflect changes in our practices or for other operational, legal, or regulatory reasons. We encourage you to review this policy periodically to stay informed about our use of cookies.

                <h2>1. What Are Cookies?</h2>
                <p>
                    Cookies are small text files that are placed on your computer or mobile device when you visit a website. They are widely used to make websites work, or work more efficiently, as well as to provide reporting information. Cookies allow a website to recognize a user's device and remember information about their preferences or past actions.
                </p>
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Definition and Purpose:</strong>
                        <p>
                            Cookies are essentially tiny digital identifiers that websites send to your browser. Their primary purpose is to store small pieces of information on your device, which can then be retrieved by the website on subsequent visits. This allows websites to "remember" you, personalize your experience, and make browsing more efficient by recalling preferences, login states, and other user-specific settings. They are fundamental to the modern web experience, enabling features like shopping carts and personalized content.

                    <li>
                        <strong>How They Work:</strong>
                        <p>
                            When you load a website, the server sends a cookie to your browser. Your browser stores this cookie. The next time you visit that same website, your browser sends the cookie back to the server. This exchange allows the server to recognize your device and retrieve any stored information related to your previous interactions. This seamless process occurs in the background, enhancing your user journey without requiring repetitive inputs.

                        <strong>First-Party vs. Third-Party Cookies:</strong>
                        <p>
                            First-party cookies are set by the website you are visiting (e.g., LOSTINFLAVOR.com). They are typically used to remember your preferences for that specific site. Third-party cookies are set by a domain other than the one you are visiting, often by advertisers or analytics providers, and are used for tracking across different websites. Understanding this distinction helps you manage your privacy settings more effectively.
                        </p>

                    <li>
                        <strong>Session vs. Persistent Cookies:</strong>
                        <p>
                            Session cookies are temporary and are erased when you close your web browser. They are used to track your activities during a single browsing session. Persistent cookies, on the other hand, remain on your device for a set period or until you manually delete them. These are used to remember your preferences over longer periods, such as keeping you logged in or remembering your language choice.

                        <strong>Cookie Data Storage:</strong>
                        <p>
                            Cookies typically store non-personally identifiable information, such as a unique ID, site settings, or browsing history. While they don't directly contain your name or email, they can be linked to other data to build a profile. It's important to understand what data is being stored and how it might be used in conjunction with other information.
